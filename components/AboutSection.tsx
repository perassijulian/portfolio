      <p>
        I’m a <strong>self-taught developer</strong> with a passion for building
        thoughtful, performant interfaces—where clean design meets solid
        engineering. I enjoy crafting{" "}
        <strong>intuitive user experiences</strong> while also digging into the
        technical foundations that make them{" "}
        <strong>secure, accessible, and scalable</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I’m focused on <strong>full-stack projects</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>modern web security</strong>. From designing custom components
        to implementing <strong>secure authentication flows</strong>, I enjoy
        learning by doing—and breaking things on purpose to understand how they
        work under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before tech, I studied and worked as an{" "}
        <strong>industrial engineer</strong>. That background gave me an{" "}
        <strong>analytical mindset</strong> and a drive for{" "}
        <strong>systems thinking</strong>, which now feeds into how I approach
        development—from optimizing workflows to designing clean codebases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my downtime, I’m probably{" "}
        <strong>exploring mountains, snowboarding</strong>, learning something
        new, or reverse engineering a web app for fun. I love working with
        people who care deeply about what they build—and why it matters.
